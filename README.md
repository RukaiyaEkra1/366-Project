🍃 Cotton Leaf Disease Detection
Using Pre-trained CNN & Transfer Learning

A deep learning project to detect and classify cotton leaf diseases from images using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks.

🚀 Overview
This notebook demonstrates how transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN (like VGG16 or ResNet) can be applied to classify cotton leaf images as healthy or diseased. Ideal for smart agriculture and early plant disease diagnosis.
