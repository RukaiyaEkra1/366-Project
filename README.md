🍃 Cotton Leaf Disease Detection
Using Pre-trained CNN & Transfer Learning

A deep learning project to detect and classify cotton leaf diseases from images using pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks.

🚀 Overview
This notebook demonstrates how transfer learning with a pre-trained CNN (like VGG16 or ResNet) can be applied to classify cotton leaf images as healthy or diseased. Ideal for smart agriculture and early plant disease diagnosis.

🧠 Key Highlights
🔍 Image classification with high accuracy

🧬 Transfer learning with pre-trained CNN models

📊 Evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy plots, and classification report

📁 Organized directory structure for easy reproducibility

📸 Dataset
Images of cotton leaves categorized into:

Healthy

Diseased

Organized in train/ and test/ directories

You can use publicly available datasets (e.g., from Kaggle)

💡 Possible Improvements
Add real-time detection using webcam or mobile camera

Deploy as a web app (Flask / Streamlit)

Expand to multi-class leaf diseases
